# Introduction

This is a simple stock price notifier, which can monitor the stock price periodically.

In `main.py`, two kinds of monitor ways are implemented:
- Showing the top gainers
- Showing those who gains more than a specific percentage

The result will be shown via Windows Toast Notification.

I only interest in Chinese Exchange Bond market, so I only implemented it, fell free to contribute any code if you want.
